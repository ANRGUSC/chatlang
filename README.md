# chatLanguageLearning

Goal: to build an interface to ChatGPT that facilitates Role-PLaying exercises while learning a new language. 
At the core of the effort is to separate out the role-play conversation (which would be in a target language, 
e.g. French, Chinese, Hindi, etc.) from meta-conversations where the learner can ask questions in a base 
language (e.g. English) about vocabulary, grammar, etc. in reference to the ongoing conversation.
